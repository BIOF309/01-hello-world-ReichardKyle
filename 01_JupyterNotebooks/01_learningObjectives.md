# Learning Objectives

1. Understand the concept, importance, and components of
reproducible research

2. Describe the architecture of a Jupyter notebook
environment, including the notebook server, programming language kernels,
interactive widgets, and situate Jupyter notebooks as part of the wider Jupyter
ecosystem.

3. Use a Jupyter notebook to create, manage and report on the
execution of a programmatic workflow using a structured document combining
narrative text, executable code, executed code output and embedded media items.
4. Be able to access the wider Jupyter community, including but not limited to
the Jupyter Google Group, Stack Overflow and communities around specific Python
packages

reproducible
research.
- [ ] Explain why reproducibility is important to the
research
community.
- [ ] List three ways that implementing reproducible
practices can
benefit your research.

**Understand the strengths of `Jupyter
Notebooks` as a
tool for reproducible research.**

- [ ] Name and describe the
components of a
`Jupyter Notebook` and how they interact.
- [ ] Explain the
concept of a
`Jupyter` ecosystem.

and
keyboard shortcuts to run cells and format text within cells.
- [ ] Create a
`markdown` cell including headers, lists, embedded code, `LaTeX`.

(online or local) you can use as you develop your `Jupyter`/`Python` research
project.
