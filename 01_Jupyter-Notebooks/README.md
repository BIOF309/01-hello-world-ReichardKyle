## Homework

Find a cool Jupyter notebook to share with the class. Use the resources notebook (01-01-14_Resources.ipynb), [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), Google, or any other means to find a notebook that interests you. You will have 60 seconds to discuss the notebook and tell everyone why you find it interesting.

## Next week

Next week, we will all present our notebooks, learn to use UNIX commands, and talk about strings. We will then build on our UNIX skills in week 3, when we cover git. Also in week 3, we will create [GitHub](https://github.com) repositories for the homework assignments and final projects.
