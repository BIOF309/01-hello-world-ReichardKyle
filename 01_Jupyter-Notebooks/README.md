# BIOF309 Fall 2017 - Week 1 (Sept 11 2017)

## Plan for today

* [Intro survey](https://goo.gl/forms/hKJGAyI0JfjKLgq73)
* Course overview
* An introduction to programming
* Why Python?
* What can you do with Python?
* Troubleshooting software installation
* Introduction to Jupyter Notebook

## Why Python
- Python is a widely-used, general-purpose language.
- Python is easy to write/read/run etc.
- Python has an awesome community and is under constant development.
- Python has a great library ecosystem with relatively little redundancy.
- Python was voted the top language of 2017 by [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages).
- Python is popular in data science and machine learning. In fact, Python is more popular than the R programming language, according to [KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/python-overtakes-r-leader-analytics-data-science.html) and [DataScienceCentral](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/python-overtakes-r-for-data-science-and-machine-learning).

## What can you do with Python?

## Activity

* [DataCamp - Python Basics](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-1-python-basics)

## Homework

Find a cool Jupyter notebook to share with the class! Use the resources notebook (01-01-14_Resources.ipynb), [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), Google, or any other means to find a notebook that interests you. You will have 60 seconds to discuss the notebook and tell everyone why you find it interesting. You can run the notebook in presentation mode or just scroll, but do **NOT** use powerpoint. Please add a link to the notebook you selected to the "cool-notebooks" channel on our [class Slack team](https://biof309.slack.com).

## Next week

Next week, we will present our chosen notebooks , learn to use UNIX commands, and talk about strings. We will then build on our UNIX skills in week 3, when we cover git. Also in week 3, we will create [GitHub](https://github.com) repositories for the homework assignments and final projects.
