* Count the number of A's
* Count the number of T's
* Determine the length of the sequence
* Divide the total number of A's and T's vs the length of the sequence
* Report the percentage of the AT content

##Introduction to UNIX/Command line

##Homework

1. Writing a FASTA file
2. FASTA file format is a commonly-used DNA and protein sequence file format. A single sequence in FASTA format looks like this:
```pyhon
>sequence_name
ACTAGCTAGCTAGCATCG
```
3. Write a program that will create a MULTI-FASTA file for the following three sequences â€“ make sure that all sequences are in upper case and only contain the bases A, T, G and C.
```python
SEQUENCE HEADER     DNA SEQUENCE
ABC123              ATCGTACGATCGATCGATCGCTAGACGTATCG
DEF456              actgatcgacgatcgatcgatcacgact
HIJ789              ACTGAC-ACTGT--ACTGTA----CATGTG
```
4. Submit your final script to the proper drop it to me page.
5. Your file should be named [yourname].HW3.fasta.py
