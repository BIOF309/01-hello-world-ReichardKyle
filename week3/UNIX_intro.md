## Finding out where you are:

###Displays your location in the file system

* pwd     # pwd (Linux)
* chdir   # chdir (Windows)


###Creates a directory

* mkdir   # mkdir directory
* mkdir   # mkdir directory


###Changes directories with a specified path (absolute path)

* cd pathname    # cd /directory/directory
* cd pathname    # cd C:/directory/directory


###Changes directories with a relative path

* cd ..
* cd..

## Absolute Paths versus Relative Paths

* Absolute paths start at the root directory in Linux and at the Hard drive Letter in Windows:

    /Users/username/Document/BIOF309/file.txt
    C:/Users/username/Documents/BIOF309/file.txt

* Relative paths are "relative" to the programs currently location.

    .\file.txt    # Current directory

## Working with files

Lists files

    ls     # ls
    dir    # dir

Create a file

    nano   # nano hello.txt
    dir >     # dir > hello.txt

Copies files

    cp     # cp thisfile.txt /home/thisdirectory
    copy   # copy thisfile.txt C:/Users/thisdirectory




Moves files

    mv    # mv thisfile.txt /home/thisdirectory
	move  # move thisfile.txt C:/Users/thisdirectory




Deletes files

    rm    # rm thisfile.txt
	del   # rm thisfile.txt



Compares the contents of files

    diff  # diff file1 file2
	fc    # diff file1 file2



Finds a string of text in a file

    grep    # grep word or phrase thisfile.txt
	find    # grep word or phrase thisfile.txt




Views contents of a file

    less    # less thisfile.txt
	more    # less thisfile.txt

To get out type "q"


Renames a file

    mv     # mv thisfile.txt thatfile.txt
	ren    # ren thisfile.txt thatfile.txt
